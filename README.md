- 👋 Hi, I’m @JohnnythePanda
- My main interests are data analysis and programming videogames. My majors are Applied Mathematics and Economics which are subjects I enjoy learning. The courses I have taken so far allowed me to gain some experience in data analysis, but I am always looking for new data analysis methods to learn. Currently, I am trying to learn about neural networks and eventually be able to code/create a neural network. In the little free time I have, I am trying to program/create videogames as my hobby. Videogames are something I very much enjoy, and being able to create an actual playable game has always been a dream of mine. Of course, since I am starting out, creating very small-scale videogames is my current goal.
